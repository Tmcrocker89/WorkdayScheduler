# Work Day Scheduler

[Link To Deployed Website](https://tmcrocker89.github.io/WorkdayScheduler/)

This is my Work Schedule page, it will allow you to type text into each hour block and then save the data by clicking on the save button, when you refresh the page the data will persist, to remove data from a block just backspace out the data and hit the save button again. The grey blocks are past time, the red block is current time, the green blocks are future time.
